# Monty-Hall-Simulation
A simulation of the Monty Hall scenario. Produces a statistical representation with optional number of plays and doors. 

We have three doors.
Behind one of these doors is a prize, and there is nothing behind the other two doors. The player selects one of the doors and
walks up to it. At this point, the game host, who knows where the prize is, stops the player and opens one of two doors that
were not chosen by the player. The prize is not behind the open door. We now have two closed doors: the one selected by the
player and one other one. The game host gives the player the opportunity to chose the second closed door instead of the door
that was initially selected. Should the player switch the door or stay with their current one ? 

The better strategy can be seen in this implementation written in Java. 

Execute MontyHall.java [n] [y]
n = number of plays
y = number of doors
